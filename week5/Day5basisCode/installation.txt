1. Goto https://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/binaries/ and download 'codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe'
2. Install the program
3. unzip FEM_fortran where you want to work on it
 - open Code:blocks
        - Choose open existing codeblocks project
        - open the .cbp file from FEM_fortran
        - on the left side you can unfold fortran sources to find your files
 - try compiling and running the code. You do this by pressing 'F9' or the icon with 'gear and play'.
 4. if compilation does not work, because compiler is not found do the following
 - Open code blocks
 - open the 'Compiler settings' menu, from the 'Settings' tab on the top
        - goto 'Global compiler settings' -> 'GNU Fortran Compiler' -> Toolchain executables
        - set the box named compilers installation directories. This should be set to <YOUR_CODE_BLOCKS_INSTALL_DIR>\MinGW
        - Change the name of the C compiler, C++ compiler, and dynamic linker to 'gfortran.exe'
